## About the game
The goal of the game is to get the most points witout dying.\
You can collect points by eating Apples! (green squares), moving the snake with the arrow keys on the keyboard.\
Each apple earns the player random amount of points between 1-4 (inclusive).
#### Example:

### The Bomb:
The main change from the classic old snake game is the Game-Bomb (the res square in game).\
The bomb explode every couple of seconds destroying anything that gets in contact with it, and respawning right after.
The bomb has diffrent explosion radius each respawn, so yo may get lucky 😉.\
